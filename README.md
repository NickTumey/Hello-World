# Hello-World
About me

My name is Nicholas Tumey. I am writing this description as part of an assignment I am doing for my software development class(SDEV 140).
I like to play games both board and video. As well as listening to music. I also enjoy analyzing content as a means of learning new aspects of the things I love.
